# Decoding RDNA™/CDNA™ Instructions with IsaDecoder API

## Motivation
AMD recently released its machine-readable GPU ISA specification - a set of XML files describing its RDNA and CDNA Instruction Set Architectures. While you can parse the XML files yourself, the easiest way to consume the specification is using the `IsaDecoder` API: Given an XML specification file, the API can read and parse it for you and even decode single instructions or whole shaders.

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `IsaDecoder` API to decode AMD GPU assembly provided in either binary or textual (disassembly) format.

In addition to this tutorial, make sure to check out the API usage examples in the [examples subfolder](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/isa_spec_manager/tree/main/source/examples) of this repository.

## Getting started with `IsaDecoder` API
The API allows you to decode either a single instruction or a whole shader/kernel.

The source code for the API can be found on the [isa_spec_manager GitHub repository](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/isa_spec_manager).

### Step 1: Instantiate `amdisa::IsaDecoder`.

`IsaDecoder` is defined under the namespace amdisa. For this tutorial, we define an `IsaDecoder` object named "decoder". 

```c
amdisa::IsaDecoder decoder;
```

### Step 2: Initialize the decoder.
Initialize the `decoder` with an input XML specification file. Make sure that the XML file you are using matches the GPU architecture that you are about to decode instructions for. For instance, use the MI-300/CDNA 3 XML file to decode MI-300/CDNA 3 kernels.

The `Initialize()` API function reads and parses the given XML specification file. Upon success, the `IsaDecoder` object is ready to decode instructions.

```c
bool is_success = api_decoder.Initialize(kPathToSpec, error_msg);
```
## A. Decoding a single instruction in textual format

Now, when we have the decoder initialized, let's learn how we can use API to decode an instruction's disassembly to retrieve its human-readable description. Consider the following textual representation of an RDNA 1 instruction: `V_CVT_PK_U8_F32`.

### Step 1: Create an empty instance `InstructionInfo`<sup>[Appendix 1]</sup> object.
The `InstructionInfo` struct is the primary structure used by the API to provide information about an instruction. Typically, an empty instance of this struct is passed to the API, which then populates its fields with the relevant data. Before we request information about an instruction, let's create an instance of `InstructionInfo`.
```c
amdisa::InstructionInfo instruction_info;
```

### Step 2: Call the `DecodeInstruction()` API function.
We then proceed to provide the instruction name `V_CVT_PK_U8_F32`, `instruction_info, and `error_msg` to `DecodeInstruction()`. The method returns true on successful decode and false if the decoding fails. The failure reason is populated in the error_msg.
```c    
bool is_success = api_decoder.DecodeInstruction("V_CVT_PK_U8_F32",
    instruction_info, error_msg);
```
That's it, on a successful decode, we get the following information from instruction_info.
```
    Instruction Name: V_CVT_PK_U8_F32
    Instruction Description:
        Convert  a single-precision float value from
        the first input to an unsigned 8-bit integer
        value and  pack the result into one byte of
        the third input using the second input as a
        byte select. Store the result into a vector register.
```

## B. Decoding a single instruction.
Now, let's try decoding a single instruction in machine code format. Consider the following binary representation of an RDNA 3 instruction: `8BEA7E6A`. Let's use the API to decode it.

### Step 1: Create an empty `InstructionInfoBundle`<sup>[Appendix 2]</sup>.
To obtain the decoded information, we pass an empty data structure `InstructionInfoBundle`. The `InstructionInfoBundle` is a simple wrapper around the `InstructionInfo` struct that was introduced use case A earlier. The bundle is designed to store multiple `InstructionInfo` instances. This is necessary because, in the RDNA 3 architecture, some instructions are "dual instructions," meaning a single binary-encoded instruction may be decode into two separate instructions. To handle and store information about both instructions, the `InstructionInfoBundle` was introduced.

```c
amdisa::InstructionInfoBundle instruction_info_bundle;
```

### Step 2: Call the `DecodeInstruction()` API function.
We then proceed to provide the decimal equivalent `instruction_binary`, `instruction_info_bundle`, and `error_msg` to `DecodeInstruction()` which returns true on successful decode and false if the decoding fails.

```c    
bool is_success = decoder.DecodeInstruction(0x8BEA7E6A,
    instruction_info_bundle, error_msg);
```
```
Output:
    Instruction Name: S_AND_B64
    Instruction Description: Bitwise AND.
    Encoding Name: ENC_SOP2
    Encoding Description:
        SCALAR ALU OPERATIONS WITH
        ONE DESTINATION AND TWO SOURCES.
        ALLOWED PATTERNS:
        SOP2 (32 BITS)
        SOP2 + LITERAL (64 BITS)
```
`8BEA7E6A` decodes to a scalar ALU instruction (`S_AND_B64`) that performs bitwise AND operation. The instruction's encoding is `ENC_SOP2` implying a scalar ALU operation with one destination and two sources.


## C. Decoding a whole shader
The API accepts and decodes a whole shader in the form of binary stream of instructions. Let's have a look at the following binary stream of instructions:
```
8BEA7E6A D6130002 00884D02
```

### Step 1: Store the stream in the vector.
```c
std::vector<uint32_t> inst_stream = {0x8BEA7E6A, 0xD6130002, 0x00884D02};
```

### Step 2: Create a vector of `InstructionInfoBundle`<sup>[Appendix 3]</sup>.
Earlier, we demonstrated how to decode a single instruction and store the decoded information in a structure called `InstructionInfoBundle`. Now, we'll decode a vector of instructions, which logically requires a vector of `InstructionInfoBundle`. So, let's create an instance of that.

```c
std::vector<amdisa::InstructionInfoBundle> instruction_info_bundle;
```

### Step 3: Call the `DecodeInstructionStream()` API.

We then proceed to provide the vector of sample instructions in machine code format `inst_stream`, `instruction_info_bundle`, and `error_msg` to `DecodeInstructionStream()` API. 

```c
bool is_success = decoder.DecodeInstructionStream(inst_stream,
    instruction_info_bundle, error_msg);
```
The output will contain the following data.
```
    Instruction Name: S_AND_B64
    Instruction Description: Bitwise AND.
    Encoding Name: ENC_SOP2

    Instruction Name: V_FMA_F32
    Instruction Description: Fused single precision multiply add.
    Encoding Name: ENC_VOP3
```
**Note**: The `V_FMA_F32` instruction is represented using two dwords (2 x 32-bit). Thus, from the given sample instructions of the shader, two instructions are decoded.

## D. Decoding a whole shader in disassembly format.
The API can also decode a whole shader in AMD's disassembly format. Decoding an entire shader in disassembly format is conceptually similar to the use case C above; the shader in disassembly format is essentially a stream of instructions. We'll now use an API to decode this shader from a RDNA 3 disassembly file that contains a single shader disassembly.

### Step 1: Create a vector of `InstructionInfoBundle`.
To obtain the decoded information, we pass an empty data structure `amdisa::InstructionInfoBundle`.
```c
std::vector<amdisa::InstructionInfoBundle> instruction_info_stream;
```

### Step 2: Call the `DecodeShaderDisassemblyFile()` API.

We then proceed to provide the path to the shader disassembly file, `instruction_info_stream`, `error_msg`, and `resolve_direct_branch_targets` to `DecodeShaderText()`.
```c
const char* kPathToShaderFile = "path/to/file";
bool is_success = decoder.DecodeShaderDisassemblyFile(kPathToShaderFile,
    instruction_info_stream, error_msg, resolve_direct_branch_targets);
```

**Note**: `resolve_direct_branch_targets` is an optional parameter. Setting it to `true` enables determining the direct branch's target instruction's index in the `instruction_info_bundle` vector which will be available in the `InstructionInfo.instruction_semantic_info.branch_info` struct's member `branch_target_index`. For example, in the following shader:
    
    s_branch    label_05F4         // 000000000000: BFA00004
    label_05E4:
    v_mov_b32   v28, 0             // 000000000004: 7E380280
    label_05F4:
    v_fma_f32   v0, s10, s10, v0   // 000000000008: D6130000 0400140A

The target instruction index of the s_branch instruction will be 2, i.e, the third instruction v_fma_f32. Indexing in the instruction_info_bundle starts from 0.

### 2. amdisa::InstructionInfoBundle ###

This output data structure is used when we decode the binary representation of the instruction.
`amdisa::InstructionInfoBundle` is a vector of `amdisa::InstructionInfo`. The reason why this is a vector is to support encodings that pack multiple instructions into a single instruction (although in most cases you should expect only a single instruction in the bundle). 

### 3. A vector of amdisa::InstructionInfoBundle ###

This output vector is used when a stream of instructions is provided to decode. On a successful decode, the decoded instruction infos are populated in this vector in the same order as provided. The first instruction's info index in the vector is 0.
